# Music History Version 1.0

This was the begining of an application to organize and filter music as a long-term project with Nashville Software School.  The project was continued in Music History-5 to make a functional application that can add, deleted and filter song titles and details.  This mock-up was made with the design and color scheme instructed. The songs are populated through 2 different JSON files.



##Running the Application

Clone the repo

    mkdir ~/projects && cd ~/projects
    git clone 
    

##Serve the application

Go to the application root folder and start the server.

    cd ~/projects/music-history
    http-server ./ 
    
Now you can open your browser and go to http://localhost:8081 (or whichever port it reports it is using) and you should see the basic mock-up.  The "More" button will add more songs to the list and you can click a delete button to deltet the song from the DOM (but not the applicatoin).
